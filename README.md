# Example Scala.js application

This is a slightly less barebone example of an application written in
[Scala.js](http://www.scala-js.org/). In particular, it links
in libraries that are indispensable in being productive working with Scala.js.

## Get started

To get started, run `sbt ~fastOptJS` in this example project. This should
download dependencies and prepare the relevant javascript files. If you open
[`localhost:12345/target/scala-2.11/classes/index-dev.html`](http://localhost:12345/target/scala-2.11/classes/index-dev.html) in your browser, it will show you animated soap bubbles by clicking on the black background. You can edit the application and see the updates be sent live to the browser
without needing to refresh the page.

## The optimized version

Run `sbt fullOptJS` and open up [`localhost:12345/target/scala-2.11/classes/index.html`](http://localhost:12345/target/scala-2.11/classes/index.html) for an optimized (~200kb) version
of the final application, useful for final publication.
